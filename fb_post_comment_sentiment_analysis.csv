As news reports suggest that President Trump is prepared to end the DACA program, Christians should reflect on the fact that Jesus was an immigrant and a refugee. In Matthew's gospel, we read that his family fled to Egypt, to escape King Herod's persecution. This story is echoed in the lives of DACA recipients, many of whose parents brought them to this country to escape oppression in their homelands.

Their peace loving ideas are uniting people of every race, culture, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality and socioeconomic background, making them ideal neighbors to raise kids around.

Their support of the ultra-rich has helped reduce income inequality throughout our great nation by allowing the trickle down of wealth from the 1% to working Americans. Their unshakable defense of the NRA has reduced gun violence and made all citizens feel safer, now that every man, woman, and child is armed. 

And as the rest of the developed world wastes time with trivial matters such as global warming (I heard climate change is only happening to people living in Paris anyway), we can thank strong Christian men like Mike Pence for keeping the focus on that which truly matters, such as keeping the gays off of our wedding cakes. God bless the party of Donald Trump.

Listen, I can't stand Trump. But no matter who would be in his shoes right now, Bernie, Hillary (who would have already attacked Russia at this point), or Cruz I think it has become abundantly clear that diplomacy, sanctions, or even threats won't deter Kim Jong Un. Dating back to his father, the Bush and Obama administrations just laughed at North Korean threats. Now it has gone from threats to active nuke and missile tests. For me, the final straw was when one of their missile tests buzzed Japan, one of our biggest allies in the region.
No, I'm not saying, ""Let's nuke N. Korea."" But we have a large contingent of warships, a carrier, and although we don't say it, obvious subs in the Korean region. We know their major test & launch sites. We need a surgical strike to take these out.
Yes, we worry about China. However, with all the economic ties between the USA & China, I doubt they'd toss that all away to defend an unhinged leader like Un, so long as we make a concerted effort to avoid as many civilian casualties as possible. I don't think Russia cares enough about N. Korea to get involved either.
The fact is we have many allies in the region that are now in immediate danger and even an ICBM launch could threaten the continental US. The longer we wait to take action, the more time we give N. Korea to improve upon their range and guidance technology of those ICBMs that could hit the US mainland.

Like I said, no matter who was president at this point of the constant escalation would need to take action. We've gone to war with non-threatening Middle Eastern countries for far less and have no business enforcing regime change in that region anyway. Terrorists in the Middle East have the potential of harming people in other countries by the 10s to 100s. Yet we level areas with no regard for civilian life in the name of that (it's really the oil, but hey, no one mentions that). N. Korea is an actually MILITARY COUNTRY that has the potential to inflict damage and death upon millions at a time, not in the future, but right now. I'd consider that a far bigger concern than Muslim Extremists.

China either needs to step in and put the clamps on N. Korea or America has to act as of yesterday. The longer we wait, the potential death toll only rises.",2017-09-03T22:55:35+0000,1258,-0.9873

Kris Kobach, Kansas Secretary of State, said there are loopholes and limitations that still allow criminals to receive DACA amnesty.

“What happens is a lot of gangbangers get arrested, but the state won’t have the resources to prosecute them all, so they’re released,” Kobach said on MSNBC on Friday. “It used to be before DACA that the county sheriffs would release them to ICE in hopes that they would deport them. But we have many cases of such individuals who are getting the DACA amnesty.”

Kobach is seeking to dispel the notion held by many DACA supporters that those in the DACA program automatically represent a “higher class” of person. Rather, he said, there are people from both ends of the spectrum.

“We shouldn’t have any illusion here,” Kobach continued. “DACA is a cross section of the illegal alien population. There are criminals and there are scholars, but it’s not an especially high achieving cross section of the population.”",2017-09-03T22:14:53+0000,480,-0.8874

Dating back to his father, the Bush and Obama administrations just laughed at North Korean threats. Now it has gone from threats to active nuke and missile tests. For me, the final straw was when one of their missile tests buzzed Japan, one of our biggest allies in the region. 
No, I'm not saying, ""Let's nuke N. Korea."" But we have a large contingent of warships, a carrier, and although we don't say it, obvious subs in the Korean region. We know their major test & launch sites. We need a surgical strike to take these out. 
Yes, we worry about China. However, with all the economic ties between the USA & China, I down they'd toss that all away to defend an unhinged leader like Un, so long as we make a concerted effort to avoid as many civilian casualties as possible. I don't think Russia cares enough about N. Korea to get involved either. 
The fact is we have many allies in the region that are now in immediate danger and even an ICBM launch could threaten the continental US. The longer we wait to take action, the more time we give N. Korea to improve upon their range and guidance technology of those ICBMs that could hit the US mainland. 

Like I said, no matter who was president at this point of the constant escalation would need to take action. We've gone to war with non-threatening Middle Eastern countries for far less and have no business enforcing regime change in that region anyway. Terrorists in the Middle East have the potential of harming people in other countries by the 10s to 100s. Yet we level areas with no regard for civilian life in the name of that (it's really the oil, but hey, no one mentions that). N. Korea is an actually MILITARY COUNTRY that has the potential to inflict damage and death upon millions at a time, not in the future, but right now. I'd consider that a far bigger concern than Muslim Extremists. 

China either needs to step in and put the clamps on N. Korea or America has to act as of yesterday. The longer we wait, the potential death toll only rises.",2017-09-03T18:41:18+0000,1718,-0.9853

Almost all of them driven by men. They're using their own property, sacrificing their own time, spending their own money, and risking their own lives for one reason: to help total strangers in desperate need.

Most of them are by themselves. Most are dressed like the redneck duck hunters and bass fisherman they are. Many are veterans. Most are wearing well-used gimme-hats, t-shirts, and jeans; and there's a preponderance of camo. Most are probably gun owners, and most probably voted for Trump.

These are the people the Left loves to hate, the ones Maddow mocks. The ones Maher and Olbermann just *know* they're so much better than.

These are The Quiet Ones. They don't wear masks and tear down statues. They don't, as a rule, march and demonstrate. And most have probably never been in a Whole Foods.

But they'll spend the next several days wading in cold, dirty water; dodging gators and water moccasins and fire ants; eating whatever meager rations are available; and sleeping wherever they can in dirty, damp clothes. Their reward is the tears and the hugs and the smiles from the terrified people they help. They'll deliver one boatload, and then go back for more.

When disaster strikes, it's what men do. Real men. Heroic men. American men. And then they'll knock back a few shots, or a few beers with like-minded men they've never met before, and talk about fish, or ten-point bucks, or the benefits of hollow-point ammo, or their F-150.

And the next time they hear someone talk about ""the patriarchy"", or ""male privilege"", they'll snort, turn off the TV and go to bed.

In the meantime, they'll likely be up again before dawn. To do it again. Until the helpless are rescued. And the work's done.

They're unlikely to be reimbursed. There won't be medals. They won't care. They're heroes. And it's what they do.

Drumpf is as clueless as a 3 year old child. He is spoon fed positive ""news"" about himself twice daily (the last person who was responsible for giving it to him just quit). Supposedly he doesn't have a computer of any kind and gets ALL of his news from Fox, Breitbart, and Infowars. He is easily triggered so contact with him has been limited in the WH by Kelly. Even the psycho Omarosa has been limited. There are some truly terrifying things going on in our house. We are dealing with a man-child who has zero ability to control himself and as a sociopath, has zero ability to empathize or have any kind of compassion for fellow human beings. This person is a racist, xenophobe, egomaniacal, sexist, chauvinist, pathological liar, who is incapable of understanding what it means to struggle or suffer. He is gathering information that until now has been considered private. They have then exposed all of that information and has let it be accessed and taken. They are trying to delete people from the voters rolls. Make sure that you are STILL registered to vote before the next election. The damage he is doing to our country will take forever to undo.

While Harvey brought the flooding, although a weak hurricane/tropical storm, it brought with it a cou[ple waves of endless rain.
Irma on the other hand has the potential to literally level buildings with its destructive winds which would most likely cause a much higher death toll. The longer its path remains a mystery, the higher the chance more people won't be able to evacuate and avoid the devastation. 
I'd rather see the weather service put out a few paths or as many possible paths so areas can prepare sooner rather than later.

The one thing that has always amazed me is that “man” has few to no predators hunting them ….. the human race keeps multiplying to the point that the earth can’t sustain their existence, but “man” keeps killing defenceless animals to the point of extinction for sport? 

At some time there will be no other animals left to hunt for sport but one – just guess which direction the hunters will point  their rifle scopes to then folks? It's rumoured that this is already happening.",2017-09-03T17:30:07+0000,3923,-0.9918

Get used to such things, global warming has doubled storm power since the 80s

Period 70-80, (just before global warming really took off)
Total number of North Atlantic storms, 95, hurricanes 48
Period 2010-2017 (Only seven years records)
Total number of North Atlantic storms, 123 Hurricanes 52
--------------------------------------------
Here's a record of cat 5 hurricanes in the pacific since the 60's.
Note how the bulk of cat 5's occur after 1990 Now, here is the proof of hurricane power MORE than doubling. Of the cat 5 hurricanes (they don't get bigger) what was the duration of their cat 5 force. Before 1990, one cat 5 lasted 20 hours. After, six, with three of them 40 hour cat 5 durations
That, is more than double the power FACT
More cat 5 hurricanes since global warming kicked in in the 80's FACT
The power of those cat 5's, double in duration, FACT
Storms have doubled in power with global warming (which is accelerating) FACT

Nope. Neither am I and neither am I a politician looking for votes but I'm mindful enough to understand basic science to realize that NOAA had left out many key details to their conclusions on climate change that would be impossible to get their end results without determining certain values and steps in reaching their conclusion. 
But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading, ‘unverified’ data.

It was never subjected to NOAA’s rigorous internal evaluation process – which Dr Bates devised.

His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a ‘blatant attempt to intensify the impact’ of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.

His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump’s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor’s ‘green’ policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal – so triggering an intense political row.

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

His nuclear program is not to defend his country. That's only a small part of it. He knows there is absolutely no danger of that, because of the support he has from China and possibly Russia. China will blindly continue to support NK without suspecting that it is creating a dangerous rival. To paint the big picture here, this is the revolution of the socialists (communists) through which they think they can overthrow the 'bourgeois' system. So this is what's behind the support of China and possibly Russia to a crazy leader. Thanks to the way the (US) Democrats attack their own US government, things become even more complicated. So, the ideology that unites all these actors is an extreme leftist ideology, of revolution. Solutions are many as always, but they are urgent. Give NK to China. Give NK to Russia. Or if not possible, a war agreement needs to be made with both Russia and China to attack NK. It's easier for the US to make an agreement with Russia, not with China. But the Democrats, and many Republicans are currently against improved relations with Russia. Without a great and close cooperation of nuclear powers, the situation will get worse and worse case scenarios become more likely.

This year, experts and analysts warn that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might use the day as an excuse for a dramatic show of force. As my colleague Anna Fifield reported:
Expectations remain high that North Korea will conduct another nuclear or missile test, or carry out some other incendiary act, to mark the most important day on its calendar: the anniversary Saturday of the birthday of Kim Il Sung, the country’s founder and the current leader’s grandfather.
In recent days, the North Korean army has threatened to annihilate U.S. military bases in South Korea in response to what it called President Trump’s “maniacal military provocations.” In response, the Trump administration warned that all options are on the table. The United States has sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean Peninsula region. Trump has tweeted that the United States will act against the country, with China or independently. It's gotten so contentious that China has publicly chastised both countries and asked them to chill.
As the world waits to see what — if anything — North Korea does, here's a look back at the country's five nuclear tests and how the United States responded:
October 2006: Analysts determine that North Korea has conducted its first nuclear test. The test produced an explosion of less than one kiloton, or the equivalent of about 1,000 tons of TNT. That is a small fraction of the size of the bombs dropped by the United States on Japan at World War II's end.
The United States considered this test a failure. Even so, American officials pushed for tough sanctions, calling for a block on all imports of military equipment to North Korea. Eventually, the United Nations passed a less strenuous measure, specifically targeted to prevent North Korea from acquiring equipment that would help it expand its nuclear program or military.
Kim Jong Un has tested nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles at an unprecedented rate since he came into power. Yet, the country is under some of the toughest sanctions ever. This is how the regime is able to funnel billions of dollars into its nuclear program. (Video: Jason Aldag/Photo: Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)
May 2009: North Korea conducts its second nuclear weapons test. The test was carried out underground. At the time, the U.S. Geological Survey recorded a magnitude 4.7 seismic disturbance. National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper Jr. later estimated that the test produced an explosion of two kilotons.
President Barack Obama called the test a “grave threat,” but military officials said this was a diplomatic, not a military, matter. The United Nations imposed tighter sanctions on North Korea — now almost all arms imports were banned. It also called for intensified weapons inspections.
February 2013: Kim Jong Un, then newly in power, conducts his first nuclear test as leader. The test was far larger than earlier experiments, with experts estimating that the bomb was between six and seven kilotons. The test coincided with South Korea's national elections and Obama's State of the Union address.
In response, the United States moved some missile defense equipment and nuclear-capable stealth bombers to South Korea. Secretary of State John F. Kerry warned that North Korea would lose in a military showdown with the United States. Kim “needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be,” Kerry said. In the wake of the test, the United Nations once again moved to tighten sanctions, extending an asset freeze to individuals and organizations helping Kim. Luxury goods were also put under sanctions.
In reality, though, by the time North Korea conducted this third test, there were few sanctions left to deploy. By 2013, the North's ability to import goods was severely limited. And Obama declined to take next steps, such as a naval blockade to block all shipments of goods. China also continued to provide the country oil and aid.
January 2016: North Korea claims to have conducted a fourth nuclear test, far underground. On state TV, Kim said the explosion came from a miniaturized hydrogen bomb and called it a “spectacular success.” Independent observers say they can't confirm that the test happened. If it did, its size is hard to measure. But they estimate that the explosive yield was between four and six kilotons.
In the months afterward, Congress passed a law empowering the administration to sanction individuals who import or export goods and money to North Korea. The United Nations passed a resolution banning North Korea from conducting “launches using ballistic missile technology.” The resolution also required all member states to “inspect cargo to/from the DPRK or brokered by the DPRK that is within or transiting their territories.” (DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name.)",2017-09-03T21:02:51+0000,3415,0.909

HOW DOES DNA TURN A CELL INTO A SHEEP, OR A BIRD, OR A HUMAN? 

When you divide a cake, the cake never gets bigger. However, when we were just a single cell and that cell kept dividing we got bigger. New material had to come from somewhere. That new material came from food. 

The sequence of various molecules in our DNA (the genetic code) directed the molecules from our mother's food, we received in the womb, to become new cells and forming all the tissues and organs of our body. When you understand how your DNA works, you'll also understand how egg yolks can become chickens. Read my popular Internet article: HOW DID MY DNA MAKE ME? Just google the title to access the article.

This article will give you a good understanding of how DNA, as well as cloning and genetic engineering. You also learn that so-called ""Junk DNA"" isn't junk at all. You will learn why it is not rational to believe that DNA code could have arisen by chance. Science points (not proves, but points) to an intelligent cause for DNA code. 

Nature cannot build DNA code from scratch. It requires already existing DNA code to direct and bring about more DNA code or a genetic engineer in the laboratory using intelligent design and highly sophisticated technology to bring DNA code into existence from scratch.. Furthermore, RNA/DNA and proteins cannot ""survive"" or function outside of a complete and living cell. 

""JUNK"" DNA ISN'T JUNK. It's we who were ignorant of its usefulness. Recent scientific research published in scientific journals such as Nature and RNA has revealed that the “non-coding” segments of DNA are essential in regulating gene expression (i.e. when, where, and how genes are expressed, so they're not ""junk""). There’s also scientific evidence showing that “Junk DNA” still codes for proteins through the cell’s use of a complex “read-through” mechanism.

I had wanted to go for 5 years but unfortunately it was not as magical a place as I had made it out to be in my own mind. The people were miserable (understandably so with the lack of sunlight and influx of tourists). It's definitely a destination for nature lovers because honestly there isn't much else to do. Also it is outrageously expensive (ie $25 for a mixed drink). But so many people love it and it's relatively inexpensive to get there. They have tourism down as far as making it easy to see the sights. I have mixed feelings, I really wanted to love it but didn't. One thing I must say is the food is amazing.
